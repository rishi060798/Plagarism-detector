Objectives
Develop a plagiarism detection system: Implement algorithms to identify and measure similarities between texts.
Evaluate performance: Compare different algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness in detecting plagiarism.
Provide a user-friendly interface: Create a simple and intuitive interface for users to check for plagiarism.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Collection: Gather sample texts for testing and evaluation.
Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
Similarity Algorithms: Implement various algorithms to measure text similarity.
Evaluation: Assess the performance of the algorithms.
Interface Development: Build a user interface for plagiarism checking.
Data Collection
We have collected a dataset of text documents from various sources, including academic papers, articles, and essays. This dataset will be used to test and evaluate our plagiarism detection algorithms.

Preprocessing
Text preprocessing involves:

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or sentences.
Normalization: Converting text to lowercase and removing punctuation.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to meaning (e.g., "and", "the").
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
